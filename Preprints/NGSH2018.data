Abstract: We calculate the character table of a sharply 
$5$-transitive subgroup of $\alter(12)$, and of a 
sharply $4$-transitive subgroup of $\alter(11)$. Our 
presentation of these calculations is new because we 
make no reference to the sporadic simple Mathieu groups, 
and instead deduce the desired character tables using only 
the existence of the stated multiply transitive permutation 
representations.
