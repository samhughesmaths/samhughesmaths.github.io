                <b>Automorphisms of virtually special groups</b><br>
               For which families of finitely generated groups G are automorphisms "tame"? For instance, one can wonder whether Out(G) is finitely generated, or whether the stretch factors of the automorphisms of G are algebraic integers. Following breakthroughs of Rips and Sela in the 90s, automorphisms of hyperbolic groups are known to satisfy both of these forms of tameness, but much less is known on automorphisms of more general non-positively curved groups. We show that automorphisms of compact special groups (in the sense of Haglund and Wise) also satisfy the same two forms of tameness. Proofs rely on non-small R-trees and a new JSJ decomposition over centralisers.

		<b>Fibring hyperbolic Coxeter groups with finitely presented kernel</b><br>
		
Following Agol’s work on virtual fibring of 3-manifolds, there has been substantial interest in both fibring higher dimensional manifolds and algebraic fibrings of finitely generated groups. Algebraic fibrings of word-hyperbolic groups have also lead to the discovery of subgroups with exotic finiteness properties. These two lines of research met in the work of Italiano-Martelli-Migliorini in the construction of a hyperbolic group with a non-hyperbolic subgroup of type F as well as a fibred 5-dimensional hyperbolic manifold, which is based on the theory of hyperbolic Coxeter groups. Previous work has produced many examples of fibred hyperbolic Coxeter groups, but finitely presentable examples have been relatively scarce. In joint work with Italiano and Migliorini, we construct infinitely many quasi-isometry classes of hyperbolic Coxeter groups in every vcd at least 3 that fibre with finitely presented kernel and obtain many examples of subgroups of type \(F_2\) but not \(F_3\).

		<b>Means on groups and degrees of commutativity</b><br>
Given a finite group \(G\), one can count the proportion of pairs of elements in \(G\) that commute -- giving a number, denoted \(\mathrm{dc}(G)\), behaviour of which has been studied since the 1960s.  Such a notion has straightforward generalisations to residually finite or amenable groups.  To make sense of this for other infinite groups G, one needs to define some sort of a nice measure or a mean on \(G\).  In this talk, I will explain how such means -- more specifically, finitely additive probability means that give the "correct" answer for cosets of subgroups -- can be constructed.  As an application of these methods, one can define \(\mathrm{dc}(G)\) for any group G, and show that \(\mathrm{dc}(G) > 0\) if and only if \(G\) is finite-by-abelian-by-finite.
This is joint work with Armando Martino.

		<b>Arithmetic link complements</b><br>
Two classical constructions of cusped hyperbolic 3--manifolds of finite volume are (some) link complements in the sphere, and quotients of hyperbolic space by congruence subgroups of Bianchi groups such as \(\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z}[i])\). A conjecture of Baker and Reid posits that only finitely many manifolds occur as both. I will discuss this conjecture in relation with well-known and conjectured properties of arithmetic groups, and present a proof of the conjecture obtained in joint work with S. Kionke.

		<b>Invariant random subgroups, elementwise 
		conservative actions and boomerang subgroups</b><br>
		Invariant random subgroups, which are probability measures on sets of subgroups, have been an important subject of research in the last 15 years and can be thought of as point stabilizers of probability measure preserving (p.m.p.) actions. We are introducing elementwise conservative (EC) actions as generalizations of p.m.p. actions, and boomerang subgroups as "generic instances" of EC actions. I will talk about what these objects are, what they have in common and what tells them apart. Topics that we will adress in this talks are Margulis' normal subgroup theorem and the Stuck-Zimmer rigidity thorem, Poincaré recurrence, non-singular dynamics, Schreier graphs and critical exponents or growth rates.

No prior knowledge on the subject is required. Based on joint works with Yair Glasner and Tobias Hartnick

		<b>The Farrell­–Tate K-theory of Out\((F_n)\)</b><br>
		

Given a (nice enough) group, there is an isomorphism, due to Lück, relating the rationalised \(K\)-theory groups of its classifying space to a large product of cohomology groups, some with rational and some with \(p\)-adic coeffecients.

In recent joint work with Irakli Patchkoria, we identify a generalised cohomology theory capturing the \(p\)-adic part of this product. Working in Out\((F_n)\), in ranks close to \(p\) we can fully compute this \(p\)-adic part and in this way produce an infinite family of odd-dimensional summands in the rationalised \(K\)-theory of Out\((F_n)\).

I will discuss these results and the tools that go into them, which range from spherical group rings to the lemma that is not Burnside's, via results about centralisers in Out\((F_n)\): I will try to explain how all these various ideas fit together!

		<b>Towards geometric finiteness in mapping class groups</b><br>
		
Given a subgroup of a mapping class group, there is a corresponding extension group, and fundamental groups of surface bundles (with injective monodromy) are exactly these extension groups.
Farb and Mosher introduced the notion of convex-cocompact subgroup of a mapping class group, and a subgroup is convex-cocompact if and only if the corresponding extension group is hyperbolic. Moving beyond this, one may wonder what happens for subgroups that are "close" to convex-cocompact. I will discuss some cases where the corresponding extension groups are hierarchically hyperbolic; I will explain what this means, what consequences this has, and speculate about notions of geometric finiteness in mapping class groups.

		<b>Prym Representations and Twisted Cohomology of the Mapping Class Group with Level Structures</b><br>
The Prym representations of the mapping class group are an important family of representations that come from abelian covers of a surface. They are defined on the level-\(\ell\) mapping class group, which is a fundamental finite-index subgroup of the mapping class group. One consequence of our work is that the Prym representations are infinitesimally rigid, i.e. they can not be deformed. We prove this infinitesimal rigidity by calculating the twisted cohomology of the level-\(\ell\) mapping class group with coefficients in the Prym representation, and more generally in the \(r\)-tensor powers of the Prym representation. Our results also show that when \(r\geq 2\), this twisted cohomology does not satisfy cohomological stability, i.e. it depends on the genus \(g\).

		<b>Sampling elements of a finite group: efficiency of the product replacement algorithm with accumulator</b><br>
		 Let \(G\) be a finite group generated by \(k\) elements. The well-known product replacement algorithm provides an effective method for sampling generating sets of \(G\). We study a refinement of this algorithm that is designed to output individual elements of \(G\). We show that after \(O(k^2\log|G|)\) steps, the distribution of the output is close to uniform on~\(G\), which improve upon the best results known to date. The proof proceeds via spectral gap estimates and uses computer assisted calculations.

                <p>Given a set of isometric actions of a given group that share common characteristics and a natural notion of equivalence between them, we can obtain a rich deformation space. Classical examples include (higher) Teichmuller spaces, outer spaces for free groups, and negatively curved metric on manifolds. For different points in this deformation space, it is also desirable to have a quantitative notion of how different they are. In the case of negatively curved metrics and Anosov representations, this can be answered from a statistical point of view, by encoding the actions in (analogues of) the geodesic flow. In this talk I will explain a joint work with Stephen Cantrell, in which we extend this philosophy and compare "compatible" geometric actions on CAT(0) cube complexes.</p>

We will use topological methods to compute virtual homological invariants of (fully) residually free groups, and use these calculations along with additional properties of residually free groups to show that direct products of free, surface and free abelian groups are profinitely rigid among finitely presented residually free groups.

In this talk, I will present a construction of thin surface subgroups in lattices of symplectic groups. The proof will rely on the theory of maximal representations.</p>

                <p>Graphs and groups with unique geodesics</p>
		<p>A graph is called geodetic if any two vertices are joined by a unique shortest path. We show that a finitely generated group whose Cayley graph is geodetic is virtually a free group. More generally, a locally finite quasi-transitive geodetic graph is a quasi-tree. The proof exploits the interplay between local structure and the structure of a boundary. This is joint work with Murray Elder, Adam Piggott, Davide Spriano and Kane Townsend.</p>

                <p>Group rings and hyperbolic geometry</p>
		<p>In the 60's Cohn showed that all ideals in the group algebra of a free group are free. Bass and Wall used this result to show that all two-dimensional complexes with free fundamental groups are standard: they are all homotopy equivalent to wedges of circles and 2-spheres. The goal of this talk is to describe recent results of this type for groups acting on hyperbolic spaces. I will explain an algorithm showing that in the group algebra of a group acting on a hyperbolic space, ideals generated by "few" elements are free (where "few" is a function of the minimal displacement of the action) and mention applications to cohomological dimension of "few relator" groups, topology of 2-complexes with hyperbolic fundamental groups,  and complexity of cell decompositions of hyperbolic manifolds. Joint work with Thomas Delzant.</p>

                <p>On the homology of the Torelli group</p>
		<p>The theory of surface mapping class groups is closely related to topology of 3-manifolds, geometry of moduli spaces, and automorphisms of free groups. The Torelli group is defined as the kernel of the mapping class group action on the homology of the surface. Its Eilenberg-MacLane space can be constructed as the moduli space of smooth complex curves equipped with a homology framing. However, unlike the case of mapping class group, we know very little about the homology of the Torelli group.  In the 1980s, Johnson computed its abelianization, but no other nontrivial homology groups had been computed explicitly yet. In 2007, Bestvina, Bux and Margalit proved that the cohomological dimension of the genus g Torelli group is 3g-5. In this talk, I will present a complete description of the top homology of the Torelli group in genus 3.</p>

		<p>Algorithms for Seifert fibered spaces</p>
		<p>Given two mathematical objects, the most basic question we can ask is whether they are the same. We will discuss this question for triangulations of three-manifolds. In practice there is fast software to answer this and theoretically the problem is known to be decidable. However, our understanding is limited and known theoretical algorithms could have extremely long run-times. I will describe a plan to show that the 3-manifold homeomorphism problem is in the complexity class NP, and discuss the important sub-case of Seifert fibered spaces.</p>

		<p>The coherence of one-relator groups</p>
		<p>(Joint work with Andrei Jaikin-Zapirain.) A group is said to be coherent if all of its finitely generated subgroups are finitely presented. In this talk I will sketch a proof of Baumslag’s conjecture that all one-relator groups are coherent, discussing connections with the non-positive immersions property and the vanishing of the second L^2 Betti number.</p>

		<p>The Morse local-to-global property</p>
		<p>One of the best understood classes of infinite groups are Gromov hyperbolic groups. This is largely because they present many aspects of negative curvature, which have important algebraic and geometric consequences. Pushing beyond the boundaries of hyperbolic groups, one can consider groups that are “negatively curved” only along some directions, known as the Morse geodesics. The philosophy is that theorems that are true for hyperbolic groups should be true for general groups along Morse direction. Although appealing, this philosophy turned out to be too optimistic, as researcher discovered pathological examples where Morse geodesics do not, in fact, behave as geodesics in hyperbolic groups.
However, such examples are very artificial. The Morse local-to-global property is a property satisfied by a very large class of metric spaces that, morally, guarantees that Morse geodesics “behave as they should”.  In this talk we will elaborate on the background and survey new developments in the theory of Morse local-to-global groups.</p>
